        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ali Rayeni. I have a PhD in Financial Economics. During my time as a PhD student, I worked on time-series modeling of firms' behavior and causal inference. I also employed numerous tools to answer my research questions, including Local Projections, machine learning methods, VAR (time series), Difference-in-Differences methods, and Instrumental Variables (causal regression). These tools were integral to my research. I also have a strong background in programming and statistics.</p>
